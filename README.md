The **Automobile User Ratings System** is a web-based platform that allows users to view, rate, and review various vehicles based on their experiences. The system provides a user-friendly interface where registered users can browse vehicle listings, submit detailed reviews, and rate vehicles on a scale. These ratings contribute to overall vehicle scores, helping other users make informed decisions.

The project supports two main roles: **Admin** and **User**. Admins can manage user accounts, vehicles, reviews, and monitor platform activity through a dashboard. Users can manage their profiles, view personalized recommendations, and track their review history.

Built using **Java (Modern Java + Collections API), JDBC, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL** for robust backend operations, the frontend is developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for responsiveness and interactivity. Hibernate ORM facilitates smooth object-relational mapping, and PostgreSQL ensures efficient data storage and retrieval.

A simple recommendation system suggests popular or highly-rated vehicles to users. The platformâ€™s goal is to help users make data-driven automotive choices and assist marketers in identifying top-performing models.
